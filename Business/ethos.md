# Our Business Ethos

![.float_right.w33 Overlook InfraTech logo](/_images/sponsor-overlook-sq.png)

* The fork we're supporting and any products we end up building on it are
  OSS from top to bottom
* We won't sell access to products, but enable success with them
* Public benefit company encodes ethos into business structure & bylaws
* Fiduciary duty includes community benefit and not just shareholder returns
* Sharing the abundance
    * profit sharing with the contributors who've enabled this success
    * work with other players in the space rather than cannibalizing it all

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* We are building a system leveraging GitHub Sponsors to automatically share a
  portion of our profits with all contributors to the codebase.
* There are a ton of details to be worked out
* And it's probably not going to be more than beer/fun money. But it's something.
* We may have done the lion's share of the forking, but we're not trying to crowd out the space
* There are options besides us for OpenVox support
