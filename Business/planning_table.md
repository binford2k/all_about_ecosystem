# A seat at the planning table

![.w66 a product planning session](/_images/planning.jpg)

* Ecosystem should have equal weight in planning sessions
* Will features lower friction or increase it?
* Will features encourage or discourage community engagement?
* Will features enable third-party content or "capture market space"?

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* The phrase "capture market space" is often synonymous with "deny space to others"
* At Puppet, inc, the closest I was able to get to this was getting the developer
  kit on the release checklist.
* But community and ecosystem impact should have been part of every major
  planning meeting.
* Because again, without users and content, the "product" is nothing.
* And as it turns out, this omission showed in all the products that failed to
  achieve significant adoption.
* Puppet was the only thing we built that was community & ecosystem first, and it's
  also the only thing we introduced successfully.
