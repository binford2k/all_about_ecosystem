# Business Incentives

![.float_right.w33 Overlook InfraTech logo](/_images/sponsor-overlook-sq.png)

* Not incentivized to build things that we can sell and artificially gate access to
* Are incentivized to find most effective & efficient solution to customers' problems
    * Improve and reuse existing tech
    * Partner with other companies
    * Build if we have to, but contribute to Vox Pupuli and everyone benefits
* Avoid "prisoner's dilemma" because we sell solutions, not things

.callout.info Not the path to a 10x unicorn, but to long-term sustainability
and community benefit. And we're already making some decent headway.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* When someone says "but your GUI is just repackaged Foreman..."
    * "yeah, it is. That's the standard. Why reinvent just to slap a label on it?"
* The "prisoner's dilemma" is a dirty cop tactic and why they separate people arrested together
    * Your best outcome (by far) is if you both hold strong.
    * But if one of you confesses and not the other, then the one who confesses has the better outcome.
    * So if you don't trust each other or have a way to communicate, you're best off confessing.
* In this context, it means that the first one to build a thing incurs the cost,
  but everyone gets the benefit.
* And that's true. It's sort of the opposite of the "first mover's advantage"
* But it's also the benefit we're selling.
* You get the benefits others have contributed as well as the ones you've paid for.
