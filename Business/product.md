.callout.quote.borderless <br><span style="font-size: 2.5em;">Ecosystem is the product!</span>

## The thing you sell only enables the ecosystem.
### *Whether it's free or very very expensive.*

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

.callout.info if there is one single slide you take a photo of and show to your boss,
let it be this one.

* Your product's ecosystem is the actual value you are generating.
* The things you build and sell only support and enable this ecosystem.
* Without the ecosystem, they are nothing.
* However you make money -- services, support tiers, dev tools, product --
  it's all contingent on the ecosystem _***existing***_.
