<ul>
<li>Some things you buy for their own uses

<ul>
<li>Bicycle, automobile, clothing, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some things don't really have their own intrinsic value:

<ul>
<li>Puppet, Ansible, Nintendo Switch, Spotify, waffle maker, web browser, etc.</li>
<li>Their value comes from ecosystem of content or things you can create</li>

<li>If all you could do with Puppet was what it came with <strong><em>then nobody would buy it</em></strong>.</li>

<p class="callout lightbulb borderless"> Content-enabling products are not solutions on their own.</p>


</div>
<div class="notes-section notes">

<ul>
<li>Honestly, Puppet and Ansible by themselves are just ways to write more consistent
shell scripts.</li>
<li>Their true value today comes from the content library that's been built up on
top of that.</li>
<li>In a world with no waffle mix, what's the use of a waffle maker?
And that'd be a sad, sad world</li>
<li>These are <u>toolboxes</u> more than standalone solutions on their own.</li>
<li>Nobody buys a tool to just have the tool but for what you can do with it

weird saw art or something</li>

<ul>
<li>Platforms: Windows, iPhone, Firefox, Puppet, Ansible, Netflix, Steam</li>
<li>The big companies who understand this concept invest VAST amounts of money into
supporting and enabling their content ecosystems</li>
<li>web browsers would not be big business today if the internet of random shit didn't exist.

<li>Microsoft needed applications for its platform. Out of the box, it really only
let you write simple text docs and play solitaire. Adding applications like
QuickBooks to do your accounting is what made it the juggernaut it is today.</li>
<li>The iphone exploded in popularity, not for being a good phone (it wasn't really)
but because the app store was the first time it became almost trivial for any
mainstream developer to distribute their apps. People today complain about annoying
and inconsistent review processes, but most of them never had to deal with physical
media supply chains or breaking into big-box sales.

<ul>
<li>If I wanted to build and sell an application in 1995, I would have to front
the cash myself to press a bunch of CDROMs, print a user manual (that was a
thing then), stuff them in boxes, send them out through distribution chains,
and hope somebody bought enough to at least break even.</li>
<li>The ecosystem existed, but it was a relatively high bar.</li>
<li>By 2005, I could sell over the Internet, but distribution and promotion was
still my problem.</li>
<li>But in 2008, all that changed. All I needed to do was poke a few buttons in
xcode and schlupp it off to the app store.</li>
<li>Not really a fan of the walled garden approach but Apple created an ecosystem
accessible to both developers and users, and that's made them a whole wad of cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can learn from these stories because the same dynamics apply to free and open
source software.</li>
<li>Even Linux itself has the same story. It became popular, not for being good,
but because it unlocked an immense ecosystem of hobbyist programmers who
<strong><em>built stuff</em></strong> for it.</li>

<ul>
<li>All you need to grow a garden is just soil, water, seeds, and time, right?</li>
<li>Turns out it's more complicated than that.</li>
<li>Not all plants have the same nourishment needs.</li>
<li>This is my house, it's a flat mound about two feet tall overgrown with succulents.</li>
<li>When we moved in, I needed to do some terraforming for drainage purposes and had
a big pile of dirt left over, so I built this mound and planted a bunch of pretty plants.</li>
<li>They looked really beautiful for a while and then they died. So I tried again
and they died again. More water, more fertilizer, they died again.</li>
<li>Ultimately I realized something; and the more seasoned gardeners probably already
know what I'm going to say.</li>
<li>I wasn't taking into account what the plants actually needed. Succulents get
waterlogged and drown if there's too much water, and too much fertilizer stresses
the plant to the point it dies.</li>
<li>The soil here is very thick -- almost clay -- and doesn't drain well.</li>
<li>So I hollowed out the mound and filled it with light quick draining potting soil,
with drainage slots and suddenly it took off.</li>
</ul>

<p class="callout">This is how communities work. You can't just throw money at them. You need
to understand how and why they work. You need to know their incentives. And you
need to show up where they are and feed their needs. Let them lead.</p>

<li>without the social expectations of how trade &amp; barter worked, slavery became the norm.</li>
<li>"labor" was just a number in the books</li>
<li>Lumber and sugarcane were raw resources to exploit</li>
<li>Nobody was there to frown at them</li>
<li>It was the first time that labor, land, and money were all commoditized at the same time and it was wildly efficient.</li>
<li>
<em>As long as you didn't care about the side effects</em> like health and happiness and sustainability</li>
<li>Sugar exports skyrocketed and investors back in Portugal made a lot of money.</li>
<li>Until the lumber ran out. Then it crashed.</li>
<li>So they did what captitalism has now made commonplace.</li>
<li>They abandoned that husk of an island and moved on to the next victim.</li>
<li>And they will not stop until the world is sucked dry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You see that in tech communities today.

<ul>
<li>When the insatiable hunger for profits outstrips what is being produced, they just begin to turn the thumbscrews.</li>
<li>Cory Doctorow calls this <em>enshittification</em>.</li>
<li>And when they get to the point where they can squeeze no more blood, then it's all simply cast aside and they move on to the next big thing.</li>
<li>And you're left to pick up whatever pieces you can and hopefully migrate to something else that can solve your problems.</li>
</ul>

<li>And this means that there's stupid competition because they're all vying to have <strong><em>it all</em></strong>.</li>
<li>This stomping competition just to one-up them is super wasteful. For example,
Puppet should never have built Bolt. It's very good now, but it took an
immense amount of work to get there. And when it failed to out-compete
Ansible, Puppet more or less gave up on it.</li>
