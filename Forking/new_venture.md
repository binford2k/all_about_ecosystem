# A New Venture
## (and an immediate pivot)

![.float_right Overlook InfraTech logo](/_images/sponsor-overlook-sm.png)

* Some of you know about the company I'm building -- consulting, custom
  development, maybe build some things
* Right now was when I was going to tell you about the products we're building
* *But things don't always go the way they're supposed to....*
* Perforce closed Puppet development and EULA-walled access to OSS Puppet
    * No packages and can only run on 25 nodes!
    * Jump through hoops to build modules and tools for the ecosystem and in
      exchange you get..... nothing
    * Treated module authors like they were being granted some kind of favor by
      being ***allowed*** to write code for the Puppet platform.
* *And we needed open source Puppet to exist in order to build on!*

.callout.cheers So we pivoted to keeping the ecosystem alive.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* The company I worked for wasn't doing those things for our community
  * a community that depended on the content ecosystem!
* So a friend and I made plans to build a company to actually do right.
  * And then they saved me some time and fired me lol ðŸ˜‚

---

* Test pipelines are all but impossible.
* Very much feels like a rug pull
* No appreciation or recognition
* Felt like being exploited -- no longer equal partners
