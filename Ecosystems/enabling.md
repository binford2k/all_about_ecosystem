# Enabling Content

![.float_right.w50 Steve Ballmer doing the developer chant](/_images/developers.gif)

* The value of a platform is in its ecosystem of content
* "Developers, developers, developers!"
* Why MS and Apple give away dev tools
* Why Apple invests so much in ecosystem
    * Enabling content developers
    * Cultivating that maker mentality

.callout.quote Steve Ballmer said that "I'm trying to tell people at that time
that third parties really mattered" hoping to drive home a simple message:
***Microsoft needed third-party developers to survive.***

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Platforms: Windows, iPhone, Firefox, Puppet, Ansible, Netflix, Steam
* The big companies who understand this concept invest VAST amounts of money into
  supporting and enabling their content ecosystems
* web browsers would not be big business today if the internet of random shit didn't exist.
    * the "browser wars" would never have happened
* Microsoft needed applications for its platform. Out of the box, it really only
  let you write simple text docs and play solitaire. Adding applications like
  QuickBooks to do your accounting is what made it the juggernaut it is today.
* The iphone exploded in popularity, not for being a good phone (it wasn't really)
  but because the app store was the first time it became almost trivial for any
  mainstream developer to distribute their apps. People today complain about annoying
  and inconsistent review processes, but most of them never had to deal with physical
  media supply chains or breaking into big-box sales.
    * If I wanted to build and sell an application in 1995, I would have to front
      the cash myself to press a bunch of CDROMs, print a user manual (that was a
      thing then), stuff them in boxes, send them out through distribution chains,
      and hope somebody bought enough to at least break even.
    * The ecosystem existed, but it was a relatively high bar.
    * By 2005, I could sell over the Internet, but distribution and promotion was
      still my problem.
    * But in 2008, all that changed. All I needed to do was poke a few buttons in
      xcode and schlupp it off to the app store.
    * Not really a fan of the walled garden approach but Apple created an ecosystem
      accessible to both developers and users, and that's made them a whole wad of cash.
* We can learn from these stories because the same dynamics apply to free and open
  source software.
* Even Linux itself has the same story. It became popular, not for being good,
  but because it unlocked an immense ecosystem of hobbyist programmers who
  ***built stuff*** for it.
