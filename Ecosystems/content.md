# Content Ecosystems

![.float_right.w45 toolbox](/_images/toolbox.jpg)

* Some things you buy for their own uses
    * Bicycle, automobile, clothing, etc
* Some things don't really have their own intrinsic value:
    * Puppet, Ansible, Nintendo Switch, Spotify, waffle maker, web browser, etc.
    * Their value comes from ecosystem of content or things you can create
* If all you could do with Puppet was what it came with ***then nobody would buy it***.

.callout.lightbulb.borderless  Content-enabling products are not solutions on their own.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Honestly, Puppet and Ansible by themselves are just ways to write more consistent
  shell scripts.
* Their true value today comes from the content library that's been built up on
  top of that.
* In a world with no waffle mix, what's the use of a waffle maker?
  And that'd be a sad, sad world
* These are _toolboxes_ more than standalone solutions on their own.
* Nobody buys a tool to just have the tool but for what you can do with it
    * You don't just hang it on the wall and show it off, except for some
      weird saw art or something
