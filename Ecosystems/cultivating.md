# Cultivating an Ecosystem

![.float_right.w50 the succulent mound at my own house](/_images/succulent_mound.jpeg)

* Without the right conditions, not even the best seeds will grow.
* Water, light, the right nutrients
* Same applies for communities
* Fertile environment and the right incentives
    * Money *(sometimes)*
    * Autonomy
    * Sense of belonging and appreciation
    * Accomplishment and recognition

* All you need to grow a garden is just soil, water, seeds, and time, right?
* Turns out it's more complicated than that.
* Not all plants have the same nourishment needs.
* This is my house, it's a flat mound about two feet tall overgrown with succulents.
* When we moved in, I needed to do some terraforming for drainage purposes and had
  a big pile of dirt left over, so I built this mound and planted a bunch of pretty plants.
* They looked really beautiful for a while and then they died. So I tried again
  and they died again. More water, more fertilizer, they died again.
* Ultimately I realized something; and the more seasoned gardeners probably already
  know what I'm going to say.
* I wasn't taking into account what the plants actually needed. Succulents get
  waterlogged and drown if there's too much water, and too much fertilizer stresses
  the plant to the point it dies.
* The soil here is very thick -- almost clay -- and doesn't drain well.
* So I hollowed out the mound and filled it with light quick draining potting soil,
  with drainage slots and suddenly it took off.

.callout This is how communities work. You can't just throw money at them. You need
to understand how and why they work. You need to know their incentives. And you
need to show up where they are and feed their needs. Let them lead.
