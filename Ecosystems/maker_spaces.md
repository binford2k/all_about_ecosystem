# Maker spaces

![.float_right.w50 Girl building with an Erector set](/_images/erector.jpg)

* All the good conferences are actually maker spaces
    * WWDC
    * reInvent
    * Kubecon
    * LinuxWorld
    * DevOpsDays
    * cfgmgmtcamp ðŸŽ‰
* Not about the vendor or product, but what you can build and create with it
    * Or share and see what others have created!

.callout.lightbulb None of the platforms are viable without a robust content ecosystem!

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Sure I tune in for the product announcements, but WWDC is not really about Apple!
    * It's in the name; World Wide ***DEVELOPER*** Conference
* reInvent is not about AWS -- Kubecon is not about Kubernetes
* Yes, there are themes, but the conferences are all about their ecosystem -- what you can build -- seeing what people have created -- get you excited to create something ON THEIR PLATFORM
* You'll go to one of these conferences and you'll find a billion dollar company
  in a booth right next to two people working out of their garage.
    * Hi, it me.
* And the most fun part about it is the collaboration that happens.
    * You built that cool thing?
    * Awesome, I built this cool thing, we could plug them together!
    * I ran into Jeremy at OSS Summit last year and now we're building our CI
      solution on top of Dagger.
* Toy companies have it figured out, Legos, Erector Set, Lincoln Logs, etc.

**These platforms are viable BECAUSE people like you and me build things on them!**
