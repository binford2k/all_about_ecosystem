# Yes, I'm a dirty Hippie

* I donâ€™t think that American style capitalism is sustainable
    * Enclosure & artificial scarcity
    * Perpetual expansion -- a cancer
    * Incompatible with choice
    * Commodification of labor, land, and money
* Wasteland of half-completed abandoned projects and community churn

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* The island of Madeira is where modern capitalism sprang into being in the 1400's
  * without the social expectations of how trade & barter worked, slavery became the norm.
  * "labor" was just a number in the books
  * Lumber and sugarcane were raw resources to exploit
  * Nobody was there to frown at them
  * It was the first time that labor, land, and money were all commoditized at the same time and it was wildly efficient.
  * *As long as you didn't care about the side effects* like health and happiness and sustainability
  * Sugar exports skyrocketed and investors back in Portugal made a lot of money.
  * Until the lumber ran out. Then it crashed.
  * So they did what captitalism has now made commonplace.
  * They abandoned that husk of an island and moved on to the next victim.
  * And they will not stop until the world is sucked dry.
* You see that in tech communities today.
  * When the insatiable hunger for profits outstrips what is being produced, they just begin to turn the thumbscrews.
  * Cory Doctorow calls this *enshittification*.
  * And when they get to the point where they can squeeze no more blood, then it's all simply cast aside and they move on to the next big thing.
  * And you're left to pick up whatever pieces you can and hopefully migrate to something else that can solve your problems.
* And this means that there's stupid competition because they're all vying to have ***it all***.
* This stomping competition just to one-up them is super wasteful. For example,
  Puppet should never have built Bolt. It's very good now, but it took an
  immense amount of work to get there. And when it failed to out-compete
  Ansible, Puppet more or less gave up on it.
* Rebuilding connections with other communities, Ansible, Foreman, etc.
* Mark your calendars for my talk next year where I report on how successful this plan is
